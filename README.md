| **From Networked to Distributed Systems** | - **Centralized Systems**: Managed by a single node. <br> - **Decentralized Systems**: Distributed processes without full coordination. <br> - **Distributed Systems**: Processes sufficiently coordinated to operate as one. <br> - **Transition**: Adding links between nodes transforms decentralized systems into distributed ones. |
| **Alternative Approaches**    | - **Integrative View**: Combines existing systems into one.<br> - **Expansive View**: Extends systems with new nodes. <br> **Definitions**: <br> - **Decentralized System**: Processes necessarily distributed. <br> - **Distributed System**: Processes sufficiently distributed for coordination.                                                       |
| **Common Misconceptions**     | - **Centralized Systems**: Often scalable, e.g., DNS: <br> - Logically centralized, physically distributed. <br> - Robust designs reduce failure points.<br> - Misconceptions about scalability and security require systematic evaluation.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Perspectives on Systems**   | - **Architecture**: System organization.<br> - **Processes**: Types and interactions. <br> - **Communication**: Mechanisms for data exchange. <br> - **Coordination**: Independent algorithms. <br> - **Naming**: Resource identification. <br> - **Consistency & Replication**: Data uniformity.<br> - **Fault Tolerance**: Partial failure handling. <br> - **Security**: Authorized access. |
| **Design Goals**              | - **Resource Sharing**: Examples: Cloud storage, peer-to-peer streaming.<br> - **Distribution Transparency**: Hides distributed nature; types include Access, Location, Replication, and Concurrency transparency.<br> - **Openness**: Seamless integration via interfaces. <br> - **Dependability**: Reliability, Availability, Safety, Maintainability.<br> - **Scalability**: Size, geography, admin. |
| **Security**                  | - **Aspects**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Authorization, Trust. <br> - **Mechanisms**: <br> - Symmetric encryption: Shared key. <br> - Asymmetric encryption: Public/private keys. <br> - Hashing: Data integrity verification.<br> - Digital signatures: Authenticity and origin validation.                                                                                |
| **Scalability Techniques**    | - **Latency Hiding**: Asynchronous communication. <br> - **Partitioning**: Distribute tasks across nodes. <br> - **Replication/Caching**: Store multiple data copies; challenge: consistency and synchronization.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Short Notes**      | Single central node manages all processes and resources.                                                                | Resources/processes are spread across nodes but lack full coordination.                                                        | Processes/resources are distributed and coordinated to work as a cohesive system.                                           |
| **Broad Notes**      | Central control provides simplicity but creates bottlenecks and risks single points of failure.                          | Limited coordination among nodes; good for fault isolation but hard to achieve global consistency.                              | Balances coordination and independence across nodes; scalable and fault-tolerant but complex.                               |
| **Definition**       | A system where all components are controlled by a central point.                                                        | A network of nodes that operate independently, without global control.                                                         | A system where processes and resources are sufficiently distributed to enable global coordination and functionality.         |
| **Classification**   | Examples: Mainframes, single-server setups.                                                                             | Examples: Peer-to-peer networks, independent IoT systems.                                                                      | Examples: Cloud computing, microservices-based architectures.                                                               |
| **Example**          | DNS root server (logically centralized, physically distributed).                                                        | Early peer-to-peer file-sharing systems like Napster.                                                                          | Google Cloud Platform, Netflix architecture.                                                                                |
| **Alternatives**     | Decentralized or distributed systems when scalability or fault tolerance is needed.                                      | Centralized for simplicity or distributed for better coordination.                                                             | Decentralized for isolated systems or centralized for simpler needs.                                                        |
| **Comparison**       | Central control vs independence of nodes vs coordination across nodes.                                                  | Focuses on autonomy but sacrifices global functionality.                                                                       | Offers the best of both worlds but introduces complexity.                                                                   |
| **Advantage**        | Easy to manage and implement; robust when limited scalability is required.                                               | Fault isolation, less dependency on a single point, and local decision-making.                                                 | Scalability, reliability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource sharing.                                                  |
| **Disadvantage**     | Limited scalability; single point of failure; bottlenecks.                                                              | Poor global coordination; hard to scale with consistency.                                                                      | Increased complexity in implementation and maintenance.                                                                     |
| **Visualization**    | ![Centralized](01-01a.png)                             | ![Decentralized](01-01b.png) | ![Distributed](01-01c.png) |
| **Architecture**     | Centralized control; single server or mainframe handles all processing and storage.                                      | Autonomous nodes interact independently with limited interconnection.                                                          | Peer-to-peer or client-server architecture; nodes operate both independently and collectively.                              |
| **Design**           | Simplistic design; focuses on a single central control node.                                                            | Moderate complexity; focuses on independent operation of nodes.                                                               | High complexity; requires synchronization, redundancy, and fault-tolerant mechanisms.                                       |
| **Scalability**      | Poor scalability; limited by the capacity of the central node.                                                          | Limited scalability due to coordination difficulties among independent nodes.                                                  | Excellent scalability; partitions workloads and scales horizontally.                                                        |
| **Reliability**      | Vulnerable to central point of failure; low fault tolerance.                                                            | Better reliability due to lack of dependency on a single node.                                                                | High reliability; handles partial failures without affecting the system as a whole.                                         |
| **Dependability**    | Depends entirely on the central node's performance and uptime.                                                          | Depends on the reliability of independent nodes; no global dependability.                                                      | Highly dependable with proper fault-tolerant and replication mechanisms.                                                    |
| **Fault Tolerance**  | Minimal fault tolerance; failure of the central node disrupts the entire system.                                        | Medium fault tolerance; some parts may fail without affecting others.                                                         | High fault tolerance; allows the system to continue functioning even with multiple node failures.                           |
| **Uses and Applications** | Banking systems, mainframe operations, small-scale enterprise systems.                                             | Peer-to-peer file sharing, localized IoT networks, small independent networks.                                                | Cloud computing (AWS, GCP), global databases, multimedia streaming (Netflix, YouTube), e-commerce platforms (Amazon).       |
