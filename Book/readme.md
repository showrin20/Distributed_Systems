##  Introduction to Distributed Systems


#### **1. Introduction: From Networked Systems to Distributed Systems**
- **Key Categories**:
  1. **Centralized Systems**:
     - Processes and resources are managed by a single central node.
  2. **Decentralized Systems**:
     - Processes and resources are distributed across multiple nodes, but without complete coordination.
  3. **Distributed Systems**:
     - Processes and resources are sufficiently distributed and coordinated to act as a single cohesive system.

- **Transition from Decentralized to Distributed Systems**:
  - Determined by the addition of interconnections:
    - Adding **1 link** between two nodes in a decentralized system.
    - Adding **2 links** between two other nodes.
    - In general: adding \(k > 0\) links can shift a decentralized system to a distributed one.


#### **2. Alternative Approaches to Distributed Systems**
- **Two Views of Realization**:
  1. **Integrative View**:
     - Combines existing networked computer systems into a unified larger system.
  2. **Expansive View**:
     - Extends existing systems by adding new computers or resources.

- **Definitions**:
  - **Decentralized System**: Resources and processes are necessarily spread across multiple computers.
  - **Distributed System**: Resources and processes are sufficiently distributed to enable effective coordination.


#### **3. Common Misconceptions about Distributed Systems**
- **Scalability of Centralized Solutions**:
  - Centralized systems often believed to be unscalable.
  - Example: The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is:
    - Logically centralized.
    - Physically distributed across multiple locations.
    - Decentralized across organizations.

- **Single Point of Failure in Centralized Systems**:
  - Misconception: Centralized systems are prone to single points of failure.
  - Reality: Robust designs can mitigate this, and centralized systems are:
    - Easier to manage.
    - Easier to make robust.

- **Understanding Misconceptions**:
  - Many beliefs about scalability, fault tolerance, and security are poorly founded.
  - A systematic approach is needed to evaluate these claims.


#### **4. Perspectives on Distributed Systems**
- Distributed systems are complex and require multiple perspectives:
  1. **Architecture**: Overall organization of the system.
  2. **Processes**: Types of processes and their interactions.
  3. **Communication**: Mechanisms for data exchange.
  4. **Coordination**: Algorithms independent of specific applications.
  5. **Naming**: Identifying resources within the system.
  6. **Consistency and Replication**: Ensuring data uniformity across the system.
  7. **Fault Tolerance**: Ability to function despite partial failures.
  8. **Security**: Ensuring controlled and authorized access to resources.


#### **5. Design Goals of Distributed Systems**
- **Primary Goals**:
  1. **Resource Sharing**:
     - Examples:
       - Cloud storage.
       - Peer-to-peer streaming.
       - Outsourced email systems.
       - Content distribution networks.
     - Observation: *‚ÄúThe network is the computer‚Äù* (John Gage, Sun Microsystems).

  2. **Distribution Transparency**:
     - **Definition**: Hides the fact that resources and processes are distributed across multiple locations.
     - **Types of Transparency**:
       - **Access**: Hides differences in data representation and access methods.
       - **Location**: Hides the physical location of resources.
       - **Relocation**: Hides that resources may be moved during use.
       - **Migration**: Hides the movement of processes across systems.
       - **Replication**: Hides that resources are duplicated.
       - **Concurrency**: Hides concurrent use of resources by multiple users.
       - **Failure**: Hides resource or process failures and recoveries.

     - **Challenges**:
       - Communication latencies and failures cannot always be hidden.
       - Full transparency may degrade performance.
       - Keeping replicas up-to-date introduces delays and costs.

     - **Scenarios Where Exposing Distribution Helps**:
       - Location-based services (e.g., finding nearby friends).
       - Handling users in different time zones.
       - Better user experience during failures (e.g., notifying users about server downtimes).

  3. **Openness**:
     - Open systems allow components to integrate seamlessly.
     - Characteristics:
       - Well-defined interfaces.
       - Interoperability with other systems.
       - Portability and extensibility of applications.

  4. **Dependability**:
     - Dependability involves ensuring system reliability and fault tolerance.
     - **Metrics**:
       - **Availability**: System readiness for use.
       - **Reliability**: Continuity of service over time.
       - **Safety**: Very low probability of catastrophic failures.
       - **Maintainability**: Ease of repairs and system upgrades.

  5. **Scalability**:
     - Distributed systems must scale across:
       - **Size**: Number of users or processes.
       - **Geographical Distance**: Physical spread of nodes.
       - **Administrative Domains**: Inter-organizational collaboration.


#### **6. Security in Distributed Systems**
- **Key Aspects**:
  1. **Confidentiality**: Information is only accessible to authorized entities.
  2. **Integrity**: Ensures resources are altered only through authorized means.
  3. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or process.
  4. **Authorization**: Checking access rights of an authenticated entity.
  5. **Trust**: Ensuring entities perform as expected under specific conditions.

- **Mechanisms**:
  - Symmetric encryption: Single shared key for encryption/decryption.
  - Asymmetric encryption: Public/private key pairs for secure communication.
  - Secure hashing: Produces fixed-length outputs to verify data integrity.
  - Digital signatures: Ensures message authenticity and origin.

---

#### **7. Scalability Techniques**
- **Strategies for Scaling**:
  1. **Hide Communication Latencies**:
     - Asynchronous communication.
     - Separate handlers for responses.
  2. **Partition Data and Computations**:
     - Distribute tasks across nodes.
     - Use decentralized systems like DNS.
  3. **Replication and Caching**:
     - Store multiple copies of data to reduce load.
     - Challenges:
       - Maintaining consistency across replicas.
       - Requires synchronization, which limits scalability.


#### **8. Classification of Distributed Systems**
- **Types**:
  1. **High-Performance Computing**:
     - Evolved from parallel computing systems.
     - Examples: Multiprocessor, multicore, and grid systems.
  2. **Distributed Information Systems**:
     - Middleware facilitates system integration.
     - Examples:
       - Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
       - Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM).
  3. **Distributed Pervasive Systems**:
     - Emerging systems with mobile and embedded nodes.
     - Subcategories:
       - **Ubiquitous Computing**: Continuous interaction with users.
       - **Mobile Systems**: Adapt to changing locations.
       - **Sensor Networks**: Collaboratively monitor and act on the environment.


#### **9. Pitfalls in Developing Distributed Systems**
- **Common False Assumptions**:
  - The network is reliable.
  - The network is secure.
  - The network topology does not change.
  - Latency is zero, and bandwidth is infinite.
  - Transport costs are zero.
  - Only one administrator exists for the system.

- **Consequence**:
  - These misconceptions often lead to unnecessary complexity and flawed designs that require extensive patching later.

### **Conclusion**
This chapter establishes a strong foundation for understanding distributed systems. It emphasizes their goals, misconceptions, classifications, and challenges, providing a roadmap for designing scalable, dependable, and secure systems.

# Slide 2


### **Architectural Styles**

**Basic Idea**  
An architectural style is defined by the following aspects:
1. **Components**: Replaceable elements with well-defined interfaces.  
2. **Connectors**: Mechanisms that mediate communication, coordination, or cooperation among components. Examples include facilities for (remote) procedure calls, messaging, or streaming.  
3. **Data Exchange**: The way data is shared between components.  
4. **System Configuration**: The overall organization of components and connectors within the system.  

### **Connectors**
A connector acts as a communication facilitator between components.  
**Examples**:  
- Remote procedure calls  
- Messaging systems  
- Streaming protocols  


### **Layered Architecture**
Layered architecture organizes the system into distinct layers, where each layer is responsible for specific tasks or functionality.  

#### **Different Layered Organizations**  
Layered architecture can have various configurations depending on the system's requirements.



### **Example: Communication Protocols**

#### **Key Concepts**
- **Protocol**: Rules for communication.  
- **Service**: Functions provided by a layer.  
- **Interface**: Boundary for interaction between layers.  

#### **Layered Communication Example**  
- A client-server model demonstrates layered communication effectively.  
- Below is an example implementation in Python:  

**Server**  
```python
from socket import *

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((HOST, PORT))
s.listen(5)
(conn, addr) = s.accept()  # Accepts connection and returns socket and address

while True:  # Run indefinitely
    data = conn.recv(1024)  # Receive data from the client
    if not data:
        break  # Stop if client disconnects
    msg = data.decode() + "*"  # Process the data
    conn.send(msg.encode())  # Send response back to the client
conn.close()  # Close connection
```

**Client**  
```python
from socket import *

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))  # Connect to the server
msg = "Hello World"  # Message to send
s.send(msg.encode())  # Send the message
data = s.recv(1024)  # Receive server response
print(data.decode())  # Display response
s.close()  # Close connection
```



### **Application Layering**

#### **Traditional Three-Layered Architecture**  
1. **Application-Interface Layer**  
   - Provides interaction with users or external systems.  
2. **Processing Layer**  
   - Contains core functionalities of the application, independent of data.  
3. **Data Layer**  
   - Manages and stores data accessed or manipulated by the application.  

#### **Observation**  
This structure is widely used in distributed information systems, often with traditional database technologies.



### **Architectural Styles**

#### **Layered Architectures**
Layered architectures organize systems into distinct layers, with each layer focusing on a specific functionality.  
Example: A simple search engine implementation where layers include:  
1. User Interface Layer handles user input and displays results.  
2. Processing Layer performs indexing and search algorithms.  
3. Data Layer stores the indexed data.  

#### **Object-Based Style**
Components are treated as objects.  
Objects interact via procedure calls, which may execute across a network.  
Objects encapsulate data and expose methods to interact with the data without revealing the internal implementation.

#### **Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA)**

**RESTful Architectures**  
REST views a distributed system as a collection of resources. These resources can be added, retrieved, modified, or deleted.  

Resources are identified through a uniform naming scheme such as URIs.  
Services provide a consistent interface.  
Messages are self-descriptive.  
After executing an operation, the service does not retain the caller‚Äôs state.  

**Basic RESTful Operations**  
| Operation | Description                          |  
|-----------|--------------------------------------|  
| PUT       | Create a new resource.              |  
| GET       | Retrieve the state of a resource.   |  
| DELETE    | Remove a resource.                  |  
| POST      | Modify or update a resource‚Äôs state.|  

**Example: Amazon S3**  
Amazon‚Äôs Simple Storage Service (S3) is a practical example.  
Objects (files) are placed in buckets (directories).  
Buckets cannot contain other buckets.  
Objects are identified by `http://BucketName.s3.amazonaws.com/ObjectName`.  

**Operations in S3**  
Create a bucket or object using PUT with a URI.  
List objects using GET on a bucket name.  
Retrieve an object using GET with a full URI.  

**RESTful Interfaces**  
RESTful interfaces are simple but require precise handling of parameters.  

**Simplification Example**  
An interface for creating a bucket named "mybucket."  

**SOAP Example**  
```python
import bucket
bucket.create("mybucket")
```  

### **Architectural Styles**

#### **Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA)**  

**On Interfaces**  
Simplified interfaces enable straightforward interactions.  

**Examples**:  
1. **SOAP**  
   ```python
   import bucket
   bucket.create("mybucket")
   ```  
   This creates a bucket named "mybucket" using a method call.  

2. **RESTful Interface**  
   ```
   PUT "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
   ```  
   This sends an HTTP PUT request to create a bucket named "mybucket."  

**Conclusions**  
Both SOAP and RESTful interfaces achieve similar goals but differ in implementation. REST is lightweight and flexible, while SOAP offers more structured messaging with built-in error handling and security features.

#### **Coordination in Architectures**  

**Temporal and Referential Coupling**  
1. **Temporally Coupled**  
   - Communication happens in real-time.  
   - Direct interactions, such as method calls or socket communication.  

2. **Referentially Coupled**  
   - Components directly reference each other. Example: Direct method invocation.  

3. **Referentially Decoupled**  
   - Components do not directly reference each other.  

   **Examples**:  
   - **Event-Based Communication**: Messages published and subscribed to by components.  
   - **Shared Data Space**: Components interact by reading and writing to a common storage.  

---

#### **Publish-Subscribe Architectures**  

**Example: Linda Tuple Space**  
Linda is a coordination model where components interact through a shared "tuple space."  

**Operations**:  
- **`in(t)`**: Removes a tuple matching template `t`.  
- **`rd(t)`**: Copies a tuple matching template `t`.  
- **`out(t)`**: Adds a tuple `t` to the tuple space.  

**Details**:  
- **Tuple Space as a Multiset**: Calling `out(t)` twice stores two identical tuples.  
- **Blocking Operations**: `in` and `rd` block until a matching tuple becomes available.  

---

**Example Code**  

**Bob**  
```python
import linda
linda.connect()

blog = linda.TupleSpace()
linda.universe._out(("MicroBlog", blog))
blog._out(("bob", "distsys", "I am studying chap 2"))
blog._out(("bob", "distsys", "The linda example‚Äôs pretty simple"))
blog._out(("bob", "gtcn", "Cool book!"))
```

**Alice**  
```python
import linda
linda.connect()

blog = linda.universe._rd(("MicroBlog", linda.TupleSpace))[1]
blog._out(("alice", "gtcn", "This graph theory stuff is not easy"))
blog._out(("alice", "distsys", "I like systems more than graphs"))
```

**Chuck**  
```python
import linda
linda.connect()

blog = linda.universe._rd(("MicroBlog", linda.TupleSpace))[1]
t1 = blog._rd(("bob", "distsys", str))
t2 = blog._rd(("alice", "gtcn", str))
t3 = blog._rd(("bob", "gtcn", str))

print(t1)
print(t2)
print(t3)
```



### **Publish-Subscribe Architectures**

**Issue: How to Match Events?**  
- **Event Description**: Events are described as `(attribute, value)` pairs.  
- **Matching Methods**:  
  - **Topic-based Subscription**: Specify attributes and values (e.g., `attribute = value`).  
  - **Content-based Subscription**: Define attributes within a range (e.g., `attribute ‚àà range`).  

**Observation**:  
- **Scalability Challenge**:  
  - Content-based subscriptions may face serious scalability issues due to the need for continuous filtering and matching of ranges across numerous events, especially in large-scale distributed systems.



### **Middleware and Distributed Systems**

**Middleware as the OS of Distributed Systems**  
- Provides common components and functions, reducing the need for separate implementations in applications.  

**Using Legacy Systems for Middleware**  
- **Problem**: Legacy component interfaces may not suit all applications.  
- **Solution**: Use wrappers or adapters to translate client requests into functions compatible with the component.  

**Wrapper Organization**  
1. **1-on-1 Wrappers**:  
   - Complexity: \(O(N^2)\), requiring \(N \times (N - 1)\) wrappers.  
2. **Broker-based Wrappers**:  
   - Complexity: \(O(N)\), requiring only \(2N\) wrappers.  

**Developing Adaptable Middleware**  
- Problem: Middleware is often designed for general use, but may need behavior adjustments for specific applications.  
- Solution: Intercept and modify the control flow to adapt functionality as needed.



### **Layered-System Architectures**

**Centralized Systems**  
- **Basic Client-Server Model**:  
  - Servers provide services; clients use them.  
  - Follows a request/reply model.  
- **Multi-Tiered Configurations**:  
  - Single-tier: Mainframe/dumb terminal.  
  - Two-tier: Client-server.  
  - Three-tier: Separate machines for presentation, logic, and data.  

**Example: Network File System (NFS)**  
- **Features**:  
  - Standardized local file system views.  
  - Remote access for uploading/downloading files.  
- **Comparison**:  
  - FTP uses a similar upload/download model.  



### **Symmetrically Distributed Architectures**

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems**  
- **Horizontal Distribution**:  
  - Logical parts operate on separate data shares.  
- **Peer-to-Peer Features**:  
  - All processes act as both client and server.  

**Structured P2P (e.g., Chord)**  
- **Principles**:  
  - Nodes in a ring structure, each with a unique identifier.  
  - Data is hashed and stored at the node with the closest matching identifier.  
- **Shortcut Links**: Speed up lookups.  

**Unstructured P2P**  
- **Flooding**:  
  - Broadcast requests to all neighbors; can limit via TTL.  
- **Random Walk**:  
  - Forward requests randomly until the desired data is found.  

**Comparison**:  
- Flooding is faster but less efficient.  
- Random walks save bandwidth but take longer.  

**Super-Peer Networks**  
- Break symmetry by introducing indexing servers for improved performance and efficient data storage decisions.



### **Hybrid Architectures**

**Cloud Computing**  
- **Layers**:  
  1. **Hardware**: Processors, routers, etc.  
  2. **Infrastructure**: Virtualization of servers and storage.  
  3. **Platform**: APIs for higher-level abstractions.  
  4. **Application**: User-facing software like office suites.  

**Edge Computing**  
- **Essence**: Servers deployed at network boundaries for latency reduction, reliability, and security.  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Resource allocation and service placement decisions.  
  - Selecting appropriate edge infrastructures.



### **Blockchain Architectures**

**Principles**  
- Immutable, append-only blocks organized in a chain.  
- Requires distributed consensus for appending blocks.  

**Consensus Mechanisms**  
1. **Centralized**: Single entity decides (not aligned with blockchain's decentralized goals).  
2. **Distributed (Permissioned)**:  
   - Consensus by a small, trusted group of servers.  
   - Suitable for smaller, permissioned systems.  
3. **Decentralized (Permissionless)**:  
   - Large-scale leader election for appending blocks.  
   - Requires robust mechanisms for fairness and security.
